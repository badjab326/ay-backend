### Avatar Yearbook

The ‘Avatar Yearbook’ - a one-stop-shop where users are able to share everything their heart desires. No need to jump through 3 applications for someone’s LinkedIn or GitHub profile. Instead, stop over at the ‘Avatar Yearbook’ where you can search through our cohort to find anything and everything we’ve chosen to share. Ranging from social media links to hobbies, book suggestions to comments- we’re looking to get our cohort in one place to stay connected, indefinitely.
